The goal of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2d world populated by herbivores and predators

Created according to the technical specifications presented in [this course](https://github.com/zhukovsd/java-backend-learning-course)


## Run Locally

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [Go](https://go.dev/) should be installed to run this project

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:krios2146/simulation-go.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd simulation-go
```

Run the simulation with

```bash
go run main.go
```
## Lessons Learned

- Go syntax (I had never written a line in it before)
- Basics of the Go type system (pointers and values were kind of new to me)
- Learned how to **not** use the `reflect` package (by initially using it for almost any type-related things)
- Learned how to use generics (still struggling with them)

Overall, I struggled a lot while trying to implement a project whose tech spec was developed for Java's OOP in a language that doesn't have all OOP features
